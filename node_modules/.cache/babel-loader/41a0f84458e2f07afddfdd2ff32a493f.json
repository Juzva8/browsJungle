Ombré brow, also known as\n          \"powdered brow\" is a soft, misty, powder-filled brow similar to the look of makeup. This means the tails of the brow are darker and fade into a lighter\n          color at the head of the brow, giving them a very subtle ombré appearance. Unlike microblading, these brows are typically done with a machine and\n          typically last longer with more retention. Over time, pigment fades about 50% leaving your clients with amazing results. It is important to get proper\n          permanent makeup ombré training when performing this procedure.\n          </p>\n          <a href='https://calendly.com/browsjungle/5hours?month=2022-02' target='_blank'>    \n          <button id='Services__row1__button'>\n              Book Now</button>\n              </a>\n        </Col>\n        </Row>\n\n\n\n\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default LipBlush;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
